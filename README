A small r/place clone using Flask and WebSockets.

You'll need a Python2 installation with the following modules:

- flask
- geventwebsocket

Afterward, make sure the `bitmap` file exists and is correctly referred to
under the `BITMAP_FILE` line in `place.py`. You can use `make_bitmap.py` to
make this file in the current working directory, or to clear an existing file.

Then, start `placews.py` somewhere (a systemd unit is provided) and run
place.py's `app` object in your favorite WSGI-compatible server.

Our live demonstration is running at http://place.cslabs.clarkson.edu/ . Please
report issues to this repository.
